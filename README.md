# Flex Flex is a new innovative Discord bot that has a large variety of functions from general games to music and moderation 

# Features
## Moderation
##### Flex Flex has a lot of moderation commands such as ban, kick and even commands like autorole and prefix
##### We try to make our bot your server as safe as possible with all our commands and auto-mod.

## Automatic
##### Flex Flex also has many automatic functions such as welcomer. 
##### It always works because we don't add functions that weren't tested by the testing team.

## Music
##### Flex Flex can even play music. It has commands such as play, stop, pause, resume, queue, history, previous, etc. 
##### You can use a link or search a song by its name. You can even listen to your favourite playlist.

## Support
##### We try to help our users as quickly and as much as possible so that you can get back to work with your server.
##### We also do our best to have as little downtime as possible so that you can have a safe and perfect server anytime.

## Updates 
##### Almost every day we add new features, fix bugs, respond to users, so the possibilities are endless. 
##### If you have an idea for our bot you can easily send it via our support server and we will review it as soon as possible.
